# React-FX

----
## Introduction
React-FX is a minimalistic, React library that defines Components with built-in CSS defaults - no JQuery.

Originally intended to only exist for my personal website, React-FX is also for those that love writing their own stylesheets but are only looking for base/ wrapper Components (e.g. Component boilerplate) with default animations.

## Components List
Here's a short list of Components:
* Container
* Card
* SplitCard

### Future Components
An informal list of Components I plan on creating sometime in the future:
* Row
* NavBar
* Button

## Maintenance
I may be slow to respond since I tend to get pretty busy.

I also have an attention span of a gnat.

I tend to create Components on a personal-need basis so updates may be sporatic.

## Contributing
I am not interested in collaborating as of now.
